# This .eslintignore file is here primarily to RE-include (unignore) at least one file
# so that running `eslint .` in this package does not fail with:
# "You are linting '.', but all of the files matching the glob pattern '.' are ignored."
#
# The shared base config currently has ignorePatterns including "**/*.config.js",
# which causes our only JS file (postcss.config.js) to be ignored. ESLint applies
# ignorePatterns from config after .eslintignore, so we cannot truly “unignore” it here.
#
# However, we still document intent and leave placeholders so that if additional
# JS/TS files are added they won’t be accidentally ignored.

# Ignore nothing explicitly (no added ignore patterns).

# If the base config stops ignoring *.config.js in the future, we WANT to lint postcss.config.js.
# Leaving a negated pattern for clarity (it has no effect while the base config ignores it).
!postcss.config.js

# When you add actual source files (e.g. index.ts), they will be linted automatically.
# If you add build artifacts, list them below, e.g.:
# dist/
# build/

# End of .eslintignore
